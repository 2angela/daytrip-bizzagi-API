This repository contains the code to develop an API service for our Day Trips Optimization application.

Day Trips Optimization aims to assist users with creating their itineraries efficiently through the prediction generated by our machine learning model. This API helps to bridge the communication between the model developed by our ML members and the android application developed by our MD members. Additionally, we provide users with general information of their desired travel destinations by leveraging Places API by Google Maps Platform.
